Approximate Computing Multi-Cycle CPU Using Verilog 

The project idea : Create a multi cycle CPU using verilog. Then try and make its ALU to perform approximate computing.
Now once these two variations are completed, synthesize the verilog codes. Use the Cadence Encounter and pass the design through
the design tool flow.
Finally use the Nangate045 library to see the layout of the design.

This repo contains all the codes, reports as well as screenshots from our design and implementation.
